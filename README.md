# react-d3-linegraph

This code is for me to practice some D3 with React.

To start this app:
- git clone git@github.com:daniellecloss/react-d3-linegraph.git
- npm install
- npm run app

The local site will show up on localhost:8081

This app starts with a base of:
- react/react-dom
- webpack and webpack-dev-server (to run and serve the app)
- babel (for transpilation)
